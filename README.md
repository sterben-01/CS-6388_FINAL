**# About this project**



I spend a lot of time on this project. I am a beginner at javascript, so I spend a lot of time trying to understand the project. But it was too hard for me, so I found some references on GitHub and used their principle to write some code.

**Some code I used from other github repo I already add comment in the code like `CITATION------`**

- Mainly, some code was reference from here: https://github.com/austinjhunt/petrinet-webgme-designstudio
- The framework was reference from here: https://github.com/kecso/StateMachineJoint
- The template file(plugin and visulizer) of this project was generate by use Webgme-CLI: https://github.com/webgme/webgme-cli
- About the seed, I draw it on the isis website then download and inport it to this project. 

**# Files**

My `SimulatorController.js` and `SimulatorPanel.js`  is under the `/src/visualizers`

I can't understand the logic for the `plugin`. So I didn't to that. My `MyNewPlugin.js` file is just default one which generated by cli tools.

For the  `SimulatorPanel.js`  .  I can understand the logic but I really don't know how to re-write it. So I use some code from github and I already cite it in the code as comment.
